'''
Python comes with Booleans (with predefined True and False displays that are basically just the integers 1 and 0). It also has a placeholder object called None. Let's walk through a few quick examples of Booleans
'''
# Set object to be a boolean
a = True
print(a)

'''
We can also use comparison operators to create booleans. We will go over all the comparison operators later on in the course.
'''
# Output is boolean
print(1 > 2)
print(1==1)

'''
We can use None as a placeholder for an object that we don't want to reassign yet:
'''
# None placeholder
b = None
print(b)
